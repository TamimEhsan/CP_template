**Properties:**

- C(n,k) is the number of regular bracket sequence of n pair of brackets with first k being the first bracket.
- C(n,k) is the number of full binary trees with n+1 internal nodes and jump-length k
- C(n,k) is also the number of nondecreasing parking functions of length n+1 whose maximum element is k+1
- C(n,k) is the number of Dyck paths from (0,0) to (n+2,n+2) which start with n-k+2 east steps and touch the diagonal y=x only on the last north step.



#### Polite Number  

<hr>
**Definition:** A polite number or staircase number is a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. 

**Values**: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,  25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,  44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, ... (sequence [A138591](https://oeis.org/A138591) in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences)).

**Formula**:  The politeness of *x* equals the number of [odd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_number) [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor) of *x* that are greater than one.

**Method**: Find the number of divisors of that number ignoring the factors of 2. 90 = 2x3^2x5^1. So the politeness is (2+1)x(1+1)-1 = 5



#### Stirling Number of Second Kind

<hr>
**Definition**: Stirling number of the second kind (or Stirling partition number) is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets and is denoted by S(n,k)
