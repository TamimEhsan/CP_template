## Simple tricks

- gcd(F(n),F(m)) = F(gcd(n,m)) where F(n) is nth fib with first two term as 0,1

- for (int x = m; x; ) { --x &= m; ... } loops
  over all subset masks of m (except m itself).

- x & -x is the least bit in x.

- a+b=a⊕b+2(a&b)

- a+b=a|b+a&b

- a⊕b=a|b—a&b

- gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,a-b) = gcd(a,a%b)

- gcd(a^m−1, a^n−1) = a^gcd(m,n)−1

- To count the number of occurrences of an element in a range, we can  carry for each element a vector containing all the positions it occurs  in increasing order. Then, `upper_bound(r)-lower_bound(l)` gives us the number of occurrences in O(log(n)).

- Number of topological sorting of a directed tree of n node is n!/( ∏ sz(v) ) where sz(v) is subtree size of node v.

- Lucas Theorem:  

  P is the prime which is to be take, No = N%P and Mo = M%P.

- For summation of series with precision upto certain decimal, sometimes we can use integration to approximate an answer.

  eg. sum(1/x) for x = 1 to 10^18, we can precalculate answer upto 10^7 and add the rest with ∫(1/x) dx => ln(x), so answer will be prec[1e7] + ln(1e18) - ln(1e7)
